/* A program to illustrate how pipe works.  The parent process reads
 * from stdin in a loop and writes each line it reads to the pipe.  The
 * child process reads from the pipe and prints each line is reads to
 * standard output.  Extra print statements are included so you can see
 * what each process is doing.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - to close standard input from the shell type ctrl-D
 *  - In this example, we are writing the same number of bytes each time
 *    and reading the same number of bytes each time from the client.
 *    This simplifies the client side.
